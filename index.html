                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm currently a Per Scholas Java Application Developer student graduating in February. Although I don't have 
                        experience working in a professional environment, in the past I have worked for parx casino as a table games dealer
                        and dunkin donuts as a crew member which allowed me to hone my adaptability, self control, paitience, effective
                        listening, and communication skills. I'm interested in moving my career into tech because so much daily functionality 
                        rely on it and I would like to be apart of the community as an application developer. I love challenges and I'm seeking
                        positions doing Java Application development and or Web development.                        
                    </p>
